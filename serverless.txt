Serverless is the concept of building and running applications that do not require server management

Serverless uses BaaS services and FaaS platforms

Cloud providers take care of infrastructure management and maintenance tasks

The arrival of serverless computing means development teams can focus on writing high-quality code

Serverless offers several benefits, such as built-in high availability and fault tolerance, faster function run times, and pay-per-request billing

Serverless computing has several constraints, including unacceptable latency for time-critical apps, complex monitoring and debugging, and no state persistence

FaaS is a type of cloud-computing service that allows you to execute code in response to events without a complex infrastructure

FaaS is a subset of serverless computing that creates applications in the form of multiple functions; and can be deployed on cloud, hybrid, or on-premises

A serverless stack comprises of FaaS, BaaS, and an API Gateway

The Serverless Framework is a free and open-source web framework written using Node.js

The use cases for serverless web applications are Web Application, Event streaming, Post-processing, and Polyglot systems

AWS Lambda provides you with an event-driven and pay-as-you-go serverless platform

Google Cloud Functions provides you with a simplified developer experience, along with Firebase for real-time data sync

Microsoft Azure promotes cloud and edge computing

IBM Cloud Functions gives you high availability and cost-effective computing

Knative promotes platform-agnostic alternate
