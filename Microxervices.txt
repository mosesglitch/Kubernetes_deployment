Modern software development often delivers centrally hosted, web-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications

Twelve factor app methodology enables developers to create more efficient SaaS applications

The twelve factors map to the code, deploy, and operate stages of the software delivery lifecycle

Microservices make each application component its own service, and each service communicates via an API

Microservices allow application components to use different technology stacks

Microservices enable individual components to scale in response to demand

Microservices lessen risks associated with change because components can iterate independently

Failures in one service do not necessarily impact other services

There are some anti-patterns to avoid when building microservices

API Gateway	API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services
CRUD	Creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
cURL	A command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs
DELETE	Request to delete a record
Flask	A micro web framework that does not require particular tools or libraries
GET	Request to retrieve a record
GraphQL	A query language that enables you to retrieve exactly what you need from the API
OpenAPI	specification Defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs
pip	Python package manager
POST	Request to create a record
Postman	An API platform for building and using APIs
PUT	Request to update a record
REST	Representational State Transfer

REST APIs provide flexible but uniform interfaces between components

REST APIs are stateless and scalable

REST APIs communicate using HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT and DELETE

REST is an architectural style defining how applications communicate

API Gateway is the door to your backend services while also enabling you to plug additional services while providing unified access

API Gateway makes it easier to scale or replace your backend services

Flask is a micro web framework to host Python web applications

cURL is used for transferring data with URLs and can be used at a command line or in scripts

Postman is a simple and popular tool for building, testing, and using APIs

Swagger helps you document and test your API

OpenAPI specification is a standard way of representing your APIs
